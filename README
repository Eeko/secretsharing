== Description
   A libary for sharing secrets in an information-theoretically secure way.
   It uses Shamir's secret sharing to enable sharing a (random) secret between
   n persons where k <= n persons are enough to recover the secret. k-1 secret
   share holders learn nothing about the secret when they combine their shares.

   This library is based on the OpenXPKI::Crypto::Secret::Split Perl module used
   in the open source PKI software OpenXPKI, which was written by Alexander Klink
   for the OpenXPKI project in 2006.

== Prerequisites
   This package requires Ruby 1.8 or later.

== Installation instructions
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)

== Synopsis
   require 'secretsharing'

   # create an object for 3 out of 5 secret sharing
   s = SecretSharing::Shamir.new(5,3)

   # create a random secret (returns the secret)
   s.create_random_secret()

   # show secret
   puts s.secret

   # show password representation of secret (Base64)
   puts s.secret_password

   # show shares
   s.shares.each { |share| puts share }

   # recover secret from shares

   s2 = SecretSharing::Shamir.new(3)
   # accepts SecretSharing::Shamir::Share objects or
   # string representations thereof
   s2 << s.shares[0]
   s2 << s.shares[2]
   s2 << s.shares[4]
   puts s2.secret
